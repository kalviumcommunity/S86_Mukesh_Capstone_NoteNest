## 🧠 Project Idea – Brief Description

**NoteNest** is a full-stack smart note-taking web application that enables users to create, manage, and upload their personal notes. With an intuitive and responsive interface, users can write notes, attach files (images or PDFs), and organize them under their own authenticated accounts. The app supports traditional login/signup as well as Google OAuth, ensuring secure access. Each note is private and user-specific, making it a safe space for organizing personal or academic information.
